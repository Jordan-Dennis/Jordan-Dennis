# JordanDennis

## Hi there

I'm Jordan Dennis and I recently graduated from a Bachelor of Science (Physics). I have contributed to [$\partial$Lux](https://louisdesdoigts.github.io/dLux/) and [`ticktack`](https://sharmallama.github.io/ticktack/), python packages for the analysis of physical data. I am an experienced `python` and `r` programmer, but also have experience with `c` and `java` among others.
